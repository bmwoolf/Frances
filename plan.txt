Here’s the step-by-step execution plan to build SynthLoop MVP, hyper-focused on speed to deployment:

Phase 1: Close the Loop (Simulated Version)
1. Define Input–Output Contract
optimize(target_molecule="limonene", host="E.coli")  
→ { 
    "knockout": [...], 
    "overexpress": [...], 
    "predicted_yield": X g/L 
  }

2. Build the Simulated Lab (Minimal Viable Physics)
Download BiGG GEMs for E. coli	BiGG Models
Run CobraPy FBA	Simulate gene edits → yield

Phase 2: Build the Optimizer Model
Parse KEGG/MetaCyc pathways to graphs	NetworkX / PyG Data
Create host-specific metabolic graph	Match BiGG to KEGG

2. Model Components
GNN + Attention	PyTorch Geometric: GATConv
RL Policy (actions = gene edits): Ray RLlib (PPO or REINFORCE)
Simulated environment: CobraPy or toy proxy

3. Reward Function
Reward = predicted yield (g/L)
Penalize over-complex edits (keep interventions minimal)

Phase 3: Deploy the API
Wrap optimize() in FastAPI	API endpoint
Store results in JSON for retraining
Package in Docker
