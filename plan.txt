Here’s the step-by-step execution plan to build SynthLoop MVP, hyper-focused on speed to deployment:

Phase 1: Close the Loop (Simulated Version)
1. Define Input–Output Contract
python
Copy
Edit
optimize(target_molecule="limonene", host="E.coli")  
→ { "knockout": [...], "overexpress": [...], "predicted_yield": X g/L }

2. Build the Simulated Lab (Minimal Viable Physics)
Task	Tool
Download BiGG GEMs for E. coli	BiGG Models
Run CobraPy FBA	Simulate gene edits → yield
Optional: Create a toy flux simulator for faster iterations (simplified FBA proxy)	

Phase 2: Build the Optimizer Model
1. Graph Representation
Task	Tool
Parse KEGG/MetaCyc pathways to graphs	NetworkX / PyG Data
Create host-specific metabolic graph	Match BiGG to KEGG

2. Model Components
Component	Tool
GNN + Attention	PyTorch Geometric (GATConv)
RL Policy (actions = gene edits)	Ray RLlib (PPO or REINFORCE)
Simulated environment	CobraPy or toy proxy

3. Reward Function
Reward = predicted yield (g/L)

Penalize over-complex edits (keep interventions minimal)

Phase 3: Deploy the API
Task	Tool
Wrap optimize() in FastAPI	API endpoint
Store results in MongoDB / JSON	For audit + retraining
Package in Docker	Easy deployment
